**Getting and cleaning Data project Week 4**

Within the repo are the following files.

*R code.*
*codebook.md.*
*Tidy_data set.*

**Contents of the files**.

Codebook.md gives a description of how the variable are set, the data set itself and a number of transformations made to accomplish cleaning it.

run_analysis.R file contains all the code that is needed to perform the below required manipulation and transformation of the data set.

  1.Merges the training data sets to create on data set.
   
  2.Extracts only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each    measurement.
   
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
  
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
  5.From the data set in step 4 above, creates a second independent tidy data set with the average for each activity and each subject.

Tidy_data.txt gives the final output for the edited code.
